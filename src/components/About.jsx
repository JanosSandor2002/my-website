      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is János Sándor, and I am currently a third-year Computer
        Science student at the Faculty of IT, Miskolc University. I chose this
        field because I have always been fascinated by the creative aspects of
        programming - the ability to design, build, and optimize solutions from
        scratch using code is something that truly excites me. Programming
        allows me to combine logical thinking with imagination, enabling me to
        approach problems in unique and innovative ways, and this is exactly
        what drew me to Computer Science in the first place. Beyond my
        university studies, I actively seek opportunities to expand my
        knowledge, especially in web development, by taking various Udemy
        courses to deepen my understanding of both front-end and back-end
        technologies. This self-driven learning helps me stay up-to-date with
        modern frameworks, best practices, and industry trends, which
        complements my formal education perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite area of study is web development. I enjoy working with React
        and React Native for building dynamic web and mobile applications, as
        well as using Express for creating robust back-end systems. I have also
        been exploring Angular, Next.js, and integrating databases such as
        MongoDB to ensure I understand full-stack development from end to end.
        CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind allow me to craft visually
        appealing and responsive designs efficiently, and experimenting with
        these tools continues to enhance my skills and creativity. I
        particularly enjoy seeing how the different layers of a web application
        interact and how my own code can directly impact the user experience in
        a tangible way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to web development, I have a strong passion for game
        development. I primarily use Godot to design and implement games, as it
        offers a perfect combination of creativity and technical
        problem-solving. Designing game mechanics, programming interactive
        behaviors, and creating immersive experiences is something I find
        extremely fulfilling. I also enjoy learning new programming languages
        and experimenting with different development environments, which allows
        me to bring fresh ideas and innovation to every project I work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my technical skills, I am very interested in expanding my
        knowledge through continuous self-learning. Alongside my university
        curriculum, I actively complete online courses and tutorials on
        platforms like Udemy to explore advanced topics in web development,
        including state management, responsive design, performance optimization,
        and best coding practices. This extra effort not only strengthens my
        practical abilities but also prepares me to tackle real-world projects
        more confidently. I strongly believe that combining formal education
        with self-driven learning is essential in the fast-evolving field of
        Computer Science.
      </p>

        Looking ahead, after completing my BSc, I plan to pursue the MSc
        Informatics Teacher program via part-time studies. My goal is to not
        only deepen my expertise but also to share knowledge with others through
        teaching, helping the next generation of students learn programming, web
        development, and other computer science concepts effectively. I see
        teaching as an opportunity to reinforce my own understanding while
        making a meaningful contribution to the learning community.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, I believe that Computer Science is a discipline that blends
        creativity, logic, and continuous learning. It offers endless
        possibilities to design innovative applications, solve complex problems,
        and explore new technologies. Whether it's developing web and mobile
        applications, experimenting with game design, or mastering the latest
        frameworks and tools, I am motivated by the idea of constantly improving
        my skills and applying them in practical, impactful ways. The
        combination of academic studies, self-directed online courses, and
        personal projects allows me to grow both as a programmer and as a
        problem solver, preparing me for a successful and fulfilling career in
        the field.
